This is a repository where I store my simple Javascript / Node.js helper files with the world
Hopefully somebody finds them useful.

- Json_Generator: This is a file I used for creating JSON checkins in a random manner
The default json stucture is established and a geolocation file is read in.
This file might be useful for someone looking to parse a CSV of Geolocation data
or indeed create a 3x array of characters from the alphabet.

- BDD: A work in progress to develop a story inspired BDD framework within 
Node.js. A story has multiple scenarios, each containing a statement that contains the keywords Given, When, Then, with optional Ands for chaining.

- Group Component: A Javascript based Group Component to bind to an XMPP server. Capable
of responding to messages directed at the group with limited commands.
